# Sustainability & Ethical Assessment

## Environmental Impact
- **Reduced Chemical Testing**: ML classification reduces need for repeated chemical analysis
- **Energy Efficiency**: Model inference uses minimal computational resources
- **Waste Reduction**: Fewer misclassified wines means less product waste

## Social Impact
- **Job Transformation**: Shifts workers from repetitive testing to quality oversight
- **Consistency**: Eliminates human bias and fatigue in classification
- **Accessibility**: Makes quality control accessible to smaller producers

## Ethical Considerations
- **Transparency**: Model decisions are interpretable via feature importance
- **Fairness**: No demographic or personal data used
- **Accountability**: Human oversight recommended for critical decisions

## Limitations & Mitigations
- **Geographic Bias**: Trained on Portuguese wines only
  - *Mitigation*: Retrain with diverse regional samples before global deployment
- **Temporal Drift**: Wine chemistry may change with climate/techniques
  - *Mitigation*: Regular model updates and monitoring

## Recommendation
Deploy with human-in-the-loop for first 3 months, then transition to autonomous operation with quarterly reviews.
